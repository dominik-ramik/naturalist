## About

NaturaList is an open source flexible taxonomic checklist web app capable of visualizing a wide variety of data for both formal and indigenous / folk taxonomies. It doesn’t come with a pre-defined set of taxonomic data you would have to fit your project in. You have the freedom to define what kind of data gets displayed and how. Your taxonomy data is pulled from a spreadsheet, making updates, change of appearance or even adding new kinds of information easy, without the need for extensive IT expertise and complex software packages.

## Quick start

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/dominik-ramik/naturalist/releases/latest) and upload it into a webhosting of your choice. Static webhosting is enough but HTTPS needs to be enabled for the app to work offline. 
- This will give you an empty instance of the app, which you will need to fill with your data.
- Open the web address on which you installed the app. You will see a message saying you need to upload some data first. Download the blank spreadsheet which you can use to bootstrap your project.
- Fill the spreadsheet with your data. Read the documentation to learn more about different parts of the spreasheet you can configure and for a sample spreadsheet with a fully developed project to explore.
- Once done, upload your spreadsheet through NaturaList. Now whoever visits your NaturaList app address will see your checklist data appearing.
- If you want to update your checklist later on, simply make the necessary edits in your spreadsheet. Then open your NaturaList app, head to the menu and click on 'Manage'. Then upload your spreadsheet to publish the update.
