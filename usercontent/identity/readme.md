You can change the following *manifest.json* fields to match your 
project name and logos (do not modify others as this may break the app):
- name
- short_name
- description
- background_color
- theme_color
- icons

See more details on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest

You can change the *favicon.png* to match your site.

When updating the source code to a new version, don't forget to skip copying the *usercontent* folder 
to prevent overwriting of your changes to the *manifest.json* or other files in the folder by the default ones.
