This folder is intentionally kept empty, this is where you will upload your checklist.json once compiled in the Manage window.

If you are on a PHP-enabled hosting, you will be able to upload the checklist directly from the app (provided you set up credentials in usercontent/identity/credentials.php).

Otherwise you can use FTP or other means to upload here the checklist.json manually.
