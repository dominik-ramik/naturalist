  "about_app": "# NaturaList\n\n## A flexible checklist app\n\n![NaturaList logo](img/icon_transparent_blue.svg)\n\n**NaturaList** is a flexible taxonomic checklist app capable of visualizing a wide variety of data for both formal and indigenous / folk taxonomies with powerful filtering and search capacities.\n\n**NaturaList** doesn't come with a pre-defined set of taxonomic data you would have to fit your project in. You have the freedom to define what kind of data gets displayed and how. Your taxonomy data is pulled from a spreadsheet, making updates, change of appearance or even adding new kinds of information easy, without the need for extensive IT expertise and complex software packages.\n\n**NaturaList** has been originally developed for the [Checklist of the vascular flora of Vanuatu](https://pvnh.net) under the **Plants mo Pipol blong Vanuatu** (Plants and People of Vanuatu) project.\n\n## Get NaturaList\n\nVisit [naturalist.netlify.app](https://naturalist.netlify.app/) for more details about NaturaList app including its latest version and a demo implementation.\n\nRead the [app documentation](./docs/) to see how to build or manage your own checklist.\n\n## How to cite the app\n\nD.M. Ramík. 2022. NaturaList, a flexible taxonomic checklist app. (version {0})\n\n## Contact the author\n\nDominik M. Ramík, [dominik.ramik{'@'}seznam.cz](mailto:dominik.ramik{'@'}seznam.cz)",
